# Validator Testing

As a developer, I know how important it is to run tests and ensure that my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code is error-free and meets industry standards. That's why I always make sure to run my code through validators before launching a project. Validators are tools that check the syntax and structure of my code to make sure it is correct and follows best practices. For HTML and CSS, I use the W3C Validator, which checks my code against the latest standards and guidelines. For JavaScript, I use the JSLint and JSHint validators, which help me catch common mistakes and ensure that my code is clean and efficient. By running my code through these validators, I can be confident that my projects will be reliable and well-built, and that they will work seamlessly on any device or browser. Overall, running tests and using validators is an essential step in the development process and helps me deliver high-quality projects to my clients.
